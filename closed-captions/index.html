				<p class="">All right, Murph, give me second. </p>
				<p class="">Aha,....thirrrd.</p>
				<p class="">- Find a gear dumbass. -Grind it!</p>
				<p class="">Shut it, Tom!</p>
				<p class="">Whatcha do Murph? -Ahh,she didn't do nothing.</p>
				<p class="">Blew a tire is all. -Murphy's Law.</p>
				<p class="">Shut up!</p>
				<p class="">- Grab the spare, Tom. That is the spare</p>
				<p class="">Get the patch kit!</p>
				<p class="">And how am I supposed to patch it out here? You got to figure it out.</p>
				<p class="">I'm not always gonna be here to help you.</p>
				<p class="">What's going on, Murph?</p>
				<p class="">Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad?</p>
				<p class="">We didn't. Murphy's law?</p>
				<p class="">Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen.</p>
				<p class="">What it means is whatever can happen will happen.</p>
				<p class="">And that sounded just fine with us.</p>
				<p class="">Whoa!</p>
				<p class="">Get in.</p>
				<p class="">Get in, let's go.</p>
				<p class="">What about the flat tire?</p>
				<p class="">Yeah.</p>
				<p class="">It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.</p>
				<p class="">Take the wheel, Tom.</p>
				<p class="">Go, go, go!</p>
				<p class="">Keep that aimed right at it.</p>
				<p class="">Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.</p>
				<p class="">Right at it.</p>
				<p class="">Stay on it.</p>
				<p class="">Here we go.</p>
				<p class="">Whoa.</p>
				<p class="">Nice one, Tom.</p>
				<p class="">Dad?</p>
				<p class="">I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!</p>
				<p class="">- Dad! -Tom!</p>
				<p class="">You told me to keep driving.</p>
				<p class="">Well, I guess that answers the old "If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.</p>
				<p class="">- We lost it. - No, we didn't.</p>
				<p class="">Want to give it a whirl?</p>
				<p class="">This way.</p>
				<p class="">Go.</p>
				<p class="">Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir.</p>
				<p class="">Nicely done.</p>
				<p class="">How long you think it's been up there?</p>
				<p class="">Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours...</p>
				<p class="">- ...ten years ago. -Heh</p>
				<p class="">So for ten years?</p>
				<p class="">- Why did it come down so low? I don't know.</p>
				<p class="">Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something</p>
				<p class="">- What? -Give me a large flatblade</p>
				<p class="">Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.</p>
				<p class="">What are you gonna do with it?</p>
				<p class="">I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do..</p>
				<p class="">like drive a combine.</p>
				<p class="">Can't we just let it go?</p>
				<p class="">It wasn't hurting anybody.</p>
				<p class="">This thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph,just like the rest of us</p>
